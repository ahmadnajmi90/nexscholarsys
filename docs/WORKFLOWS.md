```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User A
    participant User B
    participant Frontend A (React)
    participant Frontend B (React)
    participant Backend (Laravel)

## 4. Faculty Admin: Academician Verification Workflow

This flow shows how a platform Admin onboards a Faculty Admin, who then verifies a new Academician.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Phase 1: Admin Onboards Faculty Admin"
        A[Admin navigates to Faculty Admin Management] --> B{Fills out 'Create Faculty Admin' form};
        B --> C[Selects University & Faculty];
        C --> D[Enters new Faculty Admin's email];
        D --> E[System creates FacultyAdmin user & sends invitation email with temp password];
    end

    subgraph "Phase 2: Faculty Admin Activation"
        F[New Faculty Admin receives email] --> G[Clicks link, logs in with temp password];
        G --> H[Is prompted to set a new password];
        H --> I[Gains access to Faculty Admin Dashboard];
    end

    subgraph "Phase 3: Academician Registration"
        J[A new Academician registers on the platform] --> K[Selects the same University & Faculty];
        K --> L[Profile is created with 'verified' status = false];
    end

    subgraph "Phase 4: Verification by Faculty Admin"
        M[Faculty Admin logs in and views their dashboard] --> N[Sees the new unverified Academician in their list];
        N --> O{Reviews the Academician's profile};
        O --> P[Clicks the 'Verify' button];
        P --> Q[System updates Academician's status to 'verified' = true];
        Q --> R[Verified Academician gains full platform privileges];
    end

    E --> F;
    I --> M;
    L --> N;
```

## 5. AI Profile Generation from CV Workflow

This workflow details the asynchronous process of generating a user's profile from an uploaded CV.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant Frontend (React)
    participant Backend (Laravel)
    participant Queue Worker
    participant OpenAI API

    User->>Frontend (React): Uploads CV in profile settings
    Frontend (React)->>Backend (Laravel): POST /ai/generate/cv (with CV file)
    
    Backend (Laravel)->>Backend (Laravel): Store CV file securely

    Backend (Laravel)-->>Frontend (React): Return cached JSON data
    
    Frontend (React)-->>User: Populate profile form fields with AI-generated data
    User->>User: Review and save the new profile information
```

## 6. Messaging: Real-Time Conversation & Sidebar Update Workflow

This workflow shows how a new message triggers real-time updates in both the active conversation thread for all participants and the conversation list sidebar for the receiver.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Sender
    participant Receiver
    participant Frontend Sender (React)
    participant Frontend Receiver (React)
    participant Backend (Laravel)
    participant Pusher (WebSocket)

    Note over Frontend Sender, Frontend Receiver: Both users are authenticated.
    Frontend Sender ->> Pusher: Subscribes to "conversation.{id}" and "App.Models.User.{senderId}"
    Frontend Receiver ->> Pusher: Subscribes to "conversation.{id}" and "App.Models.User.{receiverId}"

    Sender->>Frontend Sender (React): Types and sends a new message
    Frontend Sender (React)->>Backend (Laravel): POST /api/v1/app/messaging/messages (body, conversation_id)

    Backend (Laravel)->>Backend (Laravel): 1. Persist Message in DB
    Backend (Laravel)->>Backend (Laravel): 2. Update conversation's last_message_id
    Backend (Laravel)->>Backend (Laravel): 3. Dispatch MessageSent event
    Backend (Laravel)->>Backend (Laravel): 4. Dispatch ConversationListDelta event

    subgraph Broadcasting Path 1: Update Active Thread
        Backend (Laravel)->>Pusher: Broadcast MessageSent on "conversation.{id}" channel
        Pusher-->>Frontend Sender (React): Push MessageSent event
        Pusher-->>Frontend Receiver (React): Push MessageSent event
        Frontend Sender (React)->>Sender: Optimistically adds message to thread
        Frontend Receiver (React)->>Receiver: Adds new message bubble to thread
    end

    subgraph Broadcasting Path 2: Update Sidebars
        Backend (Laravel)->>Pusher: Broadcast ConversationListDelta on "App.Models.User.{receiverId}" channel
        Pusher-->>Frontend Receiver (React): Push ConversationListDelta event
        Frontend Receiver (React)->>Receiver: Updates conversation list item with new preview, timestamp, and unread badge
    end

    Note over Backend (Laravel): The ConversationListDelta event is NOT sent to the sender's user channel to avoid duplicate updates.
