## ⚙️ **Meeting Reminder System**

### **Scheduled Job**
- **Command:** `supervision:send-meeting-reminders`
- **Frequency:** Every 10 minutes
- **Checks:**
  - 24-hour reminders (23-25 hours before meeting)
  - 1-hour reminders (55-65 minutes before meeting)
- **Prevents duplicates:** Tracks `reminder_24h_sent_at` and `reminder_1h_sent_at`

### **Smart Reminder Logic**
- ✅ Only sends for non-cancelled meetings
- ✅ Sends to both student and supervisor
- ✅ Works for both relationship and request-phase meetings
- ✅ Idempotent (won't send same reminder twice)

---

## 🚀 **How to Test**

### **1. Test Request Notifications**
```bash
# Student submits request → Supervisor gets email + notification
# Supervisor accepts → Student gets offer email + notification
# Student accepts offer → Supervisor gets acceptance email + notification
# Supervisor rejects → Student gets rejection email + notification
# Student cancels → Supervisor gets cancellation email + notification
```

### **2. Test Unbind Notifications**
```bash
# Supervisor/Student initiates unbind → Other party gets email + notification
# Other party approves → Initiator gets approved email + notification
# Other party rejects → Initiator gets rejected email + notification (with cooldown)
# 3rd attempt → Both parties get force unbind email + notification
```

### **3. Test Meeting Notifications**
```bash
# Supervisor schedules meeting → Student gets email + notification
# Update meeting → Other party gets updated email + notification
# Cancel meeting → Other party gets cancelled email + notification

# Run reminder job manually:
php artisan supervision:send-meeting-reminders

# Or wait for scheduler (every 10 minutes):
# 24h before → Both parties get reminder email + notification
# 1h before → Both parties get reminder email + notification
```

### **4. Test Notification Panel UI**
- Log in as student/supervisor
- Click notification bell icon
- Verify each notification type has:
  - ✅ Correct icon and color
  - ✅ Correct message format
  - ✅ Action buttons (if applicable)
  - ✅ Click actions work (navigate or mark as read)
