## How to Use

### Code Review (Before Every Commit)

```bash
# 1. Stage changes
git add .

# 2. Open AI chat and use prompts:
# - .cursor/prompts/code-review.md (general)
# - .cursor/prompts/supervision-review.md (for supervision)

# 3. Attach changed files or show diff

# 4. Fix issues AI finds

# 5. Commit
git commit -m "your message"
```

### Manual Testing (Before Deploy)

**Quick Check (10 minutes):**
```bash
# Use .cursor/testing/supervision-smoke-test.md
# Test 6 critical paths
# If pass → deploy
# If fail → debug, fix, re-test
```

**Full Test (60-90 minutes):**
```bash
# Use .cursor/testing/supervision-test-checklist.md
# For major releases
# Before merging to master
# After significant changes
```

**Setup Test Data:**
```bash
# Use .cursor/testing/test-data-setup.md
# SQL queries to setup test states
# Reset scripts for clean testing
```

## Troubleshooting

### Code Review

**Issue: AI suggests something I disagree with**
- Trust your judgment, AI isn't perfect
- But consider why it made that suggestion
- Learn from the pattern

**Issue: Review takes too long**
- Review smaller chunks (100-200 lines)
- Don't wait until 500 lines written
- Make it part of your flow

### Manual Testing

**Issue: Checklist is too long**
- Use smoke test (10 min) for quick checks
- Full checklist only for major releases
- Focus on critical paths first

**Issue: Test data keeps changing**
- Use reset scripts in test-data-setup.md
- Keep dedicated test accounts
- Document current state

❌ Complex selector issues
❌ Maintenance overhead
❌ Slower than manual testing
⏱️ **More time testing the tests than the app**

### After (Code Review + Manual Testing)
✅ Catch bugs before writing tests
✅ Systematic testing with checklists
