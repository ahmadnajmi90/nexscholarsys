## 🚨 Top 3 Critical Issues

### 1. **Missing Authorization Policies** (SECURITY RISK)
- **Impact:** HIGH - Vulnerable to authorization bypass
- **Location:** Entire supervision feature
- **Fix:** Create `SupervisionPolicy` and use `$this->authorize()` in controllers
- **Time:** 3-4 hours

### 2. **Business Logic Bugs**
- **Impact:** HIGH - Students could have multiple relationships
- **Issues:**
  - Auto-cancel missing `pending_student_acceptance` status
  - Request count validation incorrectly includes `accepted` status
- **Fix:** Update status arrays in service classes
- **Time:** 1 hour

### 3. **Missing Form Request Validation**
- **Impact:** MEDIUM-HIGH - Inconsistent validation, harder to maintain
- **Location:** All controllers using inline `$request->validate()`
- **Fix:** Create FormRequest classes for all endpoints
- **Time:** 2-3 hours
