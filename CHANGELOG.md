### Complete NexLab Real-time Collaboration System
Implemented comprehensive real-time updates for all NexLab operations using Pusher + Echo WebSocket broadcasting.
- **Full real-time sync** - All task, board, list, and member operations sync instantly across all users without page refresh

### Improved Dashboard Event Sorting & Pagination
Enhanced "Upcoming Academic Events" to prioritize events by registration deadline with smart pagination.

Implemented automatic redirection for guests viewing content directly.
- Created `RedirectGuestsToWelcome` middleware to detect unauthenticated users
- Applied to all public content: events, posts, projects, and funding pages

- Notifications appear in the panel immediately without page refresh

- **Drag and drop** workspaces between groups or use dropdown to assign to a group
- Groups displayed as collapsible Shadcn UI sections with edit/delete functionality
